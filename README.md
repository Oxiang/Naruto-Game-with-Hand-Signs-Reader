# Naruto-Game-with-Hand-Signs-Reader
A game made with Unity based on Naruto with a DIY glove that reads your hand sign using Arduino

This project was inspired after watching numerous snippets of Naruto fights and thus lead to the creation a prototype game that uses real hand signs to trigger a jutsu.

The pictures below are the prototype gloves that are used to detect hand signs. Right glove is connected to the ground while left side of the glove is connected to analogue pins with pull-up.
